I have been working on some patterns for Lambda Architecture use in Credit Risk Systems in the investment Banks. The Ivestmewnt Banking is under a number of regultary constraints dealing with Anti-financial Crime (AFC) & Compliance technology domains.

These domains involve specialist functions and skill sets within the banking industry.  A variety of vendor technology platforms, analytic models, large data management infrastructure and automated controls - some of which very new in the market and rapidly evolving -
will need to be mastered and established within the banks processes and platforms.

The main domains are Surveillance, Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Bribery & Corruption, Employee Compliance, Anti-Fraud etc.

Lamda Architecture is flexible enough to offer some form of solutions to these functional areas. It can provide reliable architecture for these needs with scalability and adaptibility in mind.

I am in the process of adaptring the needs with the help Kafka, Spark, Spark Streaming, HDFS, Hbase, Hive and Druid.

I have drawn a first cut pattern and would like to collaborate with others who are involved in these business areas.
